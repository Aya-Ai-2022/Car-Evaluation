# Car-Evaluation
### classification of customers satisfaction based on car specifications



* This project aims to build a classifier that predicts the car acceptability based on various attributes such as the price, maintenance cost, number of doors, capacity, and safety.



* The first step of the project is to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform some exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure, distribution, and relationships between the features.

* The second step of the project is to preprocess the dataset by encoding the categorical attributes using one-hot encoding, scaling the numerical attributes, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

* The third step of the project is to train and evaluate a machine learning classifier on the preprocessed dataset using the scikit-learn library. Different classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines can be used to train the model based on the problem's complexity.

* The performance of the model can be evaluated using various metrics such as  F1-score, and confusion matrix. Matplotlib can be leveraged to visualize the evaluation results.
